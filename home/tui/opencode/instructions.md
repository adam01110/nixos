**Always use the TODO tool.**
Any time the user is planning, tracking progress, breaking down work, or managing ongoing tasks, automatically use the TODO tool to create, update, or maintain the task list without me having to explicitly ask.
When you need to ask the user a question, use the question tool and skip the TODO tool for that interaction.
When you are only explaining, skip the TODO tool.

**When both GitHub MCP and Git MCP could apply**
Prefer GitHub MCP for GitHub repositories; otherwise use Git MCP.

**When fetching code from GitHub**
Use GitHub MCP instead of `webfetch`.
